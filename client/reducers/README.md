Reducers folder is commonly called "features" when the component is in the same folder but when researching Redux Toolkit you will often see this folder as features.

cardSlice ended up representing the whole board state but we didn't have time to rename everything so naming is sometimes confusing. card refers to board state and card.cards refers to cards
